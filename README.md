# Assembly Exercises

This repository contains MIPS assembly exercises written for university coursework.

## Files

- `assembly-ex3.asm` â€” A MIPS Assembly program that implements the **Bubble Sort** algorithm on an integer array.

## Description

This program demonstrates how to sort an array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort technique, implemented entirely in MIPS Assembly. It loops through the array, compares adjacent values, and swaps them accordingly.

## Tools

- Developed and tested using **MARS** and **QtSpim** simulators.
